# Overview

* This directory contains mid-infrared reference spectra for 30 trace gases for the spectral range from 650 to 2450/cm at 1/cm resolution (boxcar line-shape). The spectra have been calculate for mid-latitude atmospheric conditions (Remedios et al., 2007). The spectra cover a range of tangent altitudes from 3 to 68 km.

* The spectra have been calculated with the JURASSIC radiative transfer model, version 1.6: https://github.com/slcs-jsc/jurassic

* Please refer to the run script (run.sh) and the control file (template.ctl) for further details.
